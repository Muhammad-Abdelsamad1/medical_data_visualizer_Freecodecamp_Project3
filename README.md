# Medical Data Visualizer

This project aims to analyze patient medical data to gain insights into cardiovascular disease 🌡️.

The dataset contains information about patients such as:

- Demographics (age, gender, height, weight)
- Blood measurements (cholesterol, glucose)  
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, drinking, physical activity)
- Blood pressure readings
- Whether they have cardiovascular disease (cardio)

The following tasks will be performed:

1. 📊 Create visualizations to compare patients with and without cardiovascular disease.

2. 🧪 Transform the data by:
   - Flagging patients as overweight    
   - Normalizing cholesterol and glucose values  
   - Converting to long format   

3. 🧹 Clean the data by:
   - Removing patients with invalid height/weight  
   - Filtering outliers   

4. 📊 Plot a correlation matrix to see correlated variables  

The end goal is to😎 gain useful insights from the data to better understand:   

- How lifestyle factors influence cardiovascular risk  
- What biomarkers are most predictive of cardiovascular disease
- How demographic factors are related  

The visualizations and analysis can help clinicians and researchers to better identify at-risk patients and determine the most effective prevention strategies.   

To replicate this analysis:

1. 💻 Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements from `requirements.txt`   
3. Run `jupyter notebook medical_data_visualizer.ipynb` to view and execute the code!
